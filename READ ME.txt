Tantillus Laser Cutter Metric Edition Solidworks 2012 Model V0.5

*********************************************************************
THIS IS ALWAYS A WORK IN PROGRESS. 
THERE ARE PROBABLY THINGS WRONG WITH HACKED CONFIGS, ALLWAYS CHECK BEFORE USING
THE STANDARD CONFIG HAS BEEN USED MANY TIMES NOW SO IS RELATIVELY SAFE
*********************************************************************

 
If you print off this model and things are wrong do not blame me!

Check each part for configurations. 

Some parts have 3d print configurations, and laser cutter offset configurations.

Top Level Assembly has display states for removing covers. Also Configurations for various hacks I have done to my machine.
Many configs now through models!
