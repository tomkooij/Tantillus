THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS, THERE MAYBE THINGS WRONG WITH MODEL.
THERE HAS NOT BEEN A FULLY ASSEMBLED, WORKING MACHINE OF THIS MODEL YET!

If you print off this model and things are wrong do not blame me!

Check each part for configurations. 

Some parts have 3d print configurations, and laser cutter offset configurations.

Top Level Assembly has display states for removing covers.


Cheers
